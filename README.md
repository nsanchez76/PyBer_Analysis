# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the PyBer ride-sharing data grouped by city type. From this summary data, a multiple-line 
plot was also created to show the total weekly fares for each city type. This anslysis will be used by Pyber Executives to make informed decisions
regarding the business 

## Methods

Python 3.7.13 and Pandas 1.3.5 were used to create the summary data frame .
Pandas 1.3.5 and Matplotlib 3.5.1 were used to create the multiple-line plot.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The summary table shows that the "Urban Total Fares" is the largest of the 3 city types. The "Rural Total Fares" is the smallest value. These data match with the "Urban" city type havinghe the largest number of "Total Rides", and the "Rural: city type having the least. There is a switch in order when looking at the "Average Fare Per Ride" and "Average Fare Pre Driver", where "Rural" has the highest values in both categories, and "Urban" has the smallest.

When plotting "Total Fares By City Type" on a multi-line chart, it is further understood that the "Urban" city type brings in the most as compared to the "Suburban" and "Rural" city types.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
