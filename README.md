# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the PyBer ride-sharing data grouped by city type. From this summary data, a multiple-line 
plot was also created to show the total weekly fares for each city type. This anslysis will be used by Pyber Executives to make informed decisions
regarding the business.

## Methods

Python 3.7.13 and Pandas 1.3.5 were used to create the summary data frame .

Pandas 1.3.5 and Matplotlib 3.5.1 were used to create the multiple-line plot.

## Results

The summary table (below) shows that the "Urban" city type has the largest "Total Fares" of the 3 city types. The "Rural" city type has the smallest 
"Total Fares" value.  These data match with the "Urban" city type havinghe the largest number of "Total Rides", and the "Rural" city type having the 
least. 

There is a switch in order when looking at the "Average Fare Per Ride" and "Average Fare Pre Driver". The "Rural" has the highest values in both
categories, and "Urban" has the smallest.

When plotting "Total Fares By City Type" on a multi-line chart (below), it is further understood that the "Urban" city type brings in the most revenue 
as compared to the "Suburban" and "Rural" city types.

## Summary

Based on the results of this analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

1. The "Rural" cities could increase "Total Fares" if more drivers were added.

2. The fare charged in the "Suburban" cities could be increased to increase "Total Fares".

3. The number of drivers in the "Urban" cities could be decreased and still bring in the same amount of "Total Fares".
